The aviation industry is in the middle of an unprecedented hiring wave. From commercial airlines to private operators, the need for trained, qualified pilots has never been greater. For aspiring aviators, this moment represents an extraordinary opportunity.

# A Growing Industry

Private aviation and airlines alike are expanding rapidly, fueling demand for trained pilots worldwide.

NetJets, the world’s largest private jet operator, recently reported that it expects to take delivery of around 90 new aircraft this year, virtually all already spoken for by customers.

Despite market uncertainty, the company sees “no signs of slowdown” in demand for private aviation. With only about 14% of the potential market currently flying privately, there’s still vast room for growth.

This story is mirrored across the industry. Airlines, large and small, continue to expand their fleets, international travel is rebounding, and business and leisure travel are climbing steadily.

# The Pilot Shortage

Demand for private aviation is climbing as fleets expand and more travelers turn to business jets.

According to industry forecasts, thousands of new pilots will be needed every year for the next two decades to keep pace with retirements and new aircraft entering service.

This shortage is already driving competitive hiring and historic pay raises. For example, NetJets pilots recently secured a contract guaranteeing a 52.5% increase in compensation through 2029.
