# The History of the Shirt-Cutting Tradition

The roots of this tradition date back to the early days of flight training, long before headsets and electronic devices.  Communication between instructors and students was very limited in the noisy airplane. Instructors, often sitting behind the student in the cockpit, would tug on the back of the student’s shirt to provide corrections. Once the student successfully flew solo, cutting the shirt symbolized their independence—no longer requiring the instructor’s physical guidance.

# The Significance of the First Solo Flight

The first solo flight is one of the most pivotal moments in a pilot’s training. It represents the culmination of hard work, dedication, and mastering essential flying skills. After completing this flight, the instructor traditionally cuts the back of the pilot’s shirt, marking the student’s new status as a solo pilot.

# Why This Tradition Endures

Originally, the shirt back was cut by the instructor in the shape of an upside down “V”.  With the point near the collar, the cut angled downward to the sides of the shirt. Since the new pilot no longer needed that center material to receive the tug of instruction, the instructor was symbolically giving WINGS to the new aviator.

Despite advancements in aviation technology, the tradition of cutting the shirt after a first solo flight continues to thrive. It serves as a powerful reminder of a pilot’s progress, independence, and entry into the ranks of countless aviators who have come before them.

# A Keepsake and Milestone

The cut shirt often becomes a keepsake, a reminder of this significant achievement. Many flight schools write the date and details of the flight on the shirt and display it on their walls as a tribute to the pilot’s success.  Some students go a step further and then have the shirt cutout decorated to reflect their personality, their heritage or even quotes from their instructors.
