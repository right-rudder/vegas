Vegas Aviation is proud to partner with **Purdue Global**, one of the nation’s most respected aviation universities, to offer students an exciting way to **earn up to 45 college credits** toward a **Bachelor of Science in Professional Flight** for their flight training.  

Future airline captains train through Purdue Global’s Professional Flight Program — combining flight training with an online bachelor’s degree.  

Join us on **Friday, October 31 at 12 PM** for a special presentation from **Andrew Rachmell, Director of Educational Partnerships at Purdue Global**.

# **Earn College Credit for Your Flight Training**

Through Purdue Global’s Professional Flight Degree Pathway, students who complete their pilot certificates and ratings with Vegas Aviation can receive up to 45 transfer credits toward a Purdue Global bachelor’s degree.  
That means you can complete your degree in **as little as 2–3 years** — while continuing to fly, instruct, or work full-time.

# **Why This Matters for Future Pilots**

Airlines around the world are facing one of the **largest pilot shortages in history**. More than 600,000 new pilots will be needed by 2040, and students who combine flight training with a university degree have a clear advantage when it’s time to advance their careers.
