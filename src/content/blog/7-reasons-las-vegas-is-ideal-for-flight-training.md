# 1.  300 +Days of Sunshine = More Flight Time

- Las Vegas enjoys one of the most reliable weather patterns in the country, with over **300 days of visual flying conditions (VFR)** annually.
- Fewer weather cancellations mean you fly more often, progress faster, and avoid the common scheduling frustrations students face in more humid or storm-prone regions.
- This consistency benefits both part-time recreational students and full-time career-track pilots who need to log hours efficiently.

# 2. Mixed Airspace = Real-World Pilot Skills

Las Vegas offers student pilots a wide range of airspace environments within a short flight radius — perfect for building real-world flying skills. Here’s a look at the mix of nearby airports and their classifications:

- **Harry Reid International Airport (KLAS)** – Class **B**  
  Major commercial airport with complex operations and busy airspace — ideal for building confidence in ATC communication and high-density environments.

- **Nellis Air Force Base (KLSV)** – Class **B (Restricted)**  
  Military-controlled airspace north of Las Vegas, providing exposure to **Special Use Airspace (SUA)** and the need for precise airspace awareness.

- **Creech Air Force Base (KINS)** – Class **D**  
  An active military base west of Las Vegas, Creech is a hub for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** operations — also known as **advanced military drones**. Training nearby helps students understand how drones are managed in controlled airspace and the importance of coordination in mixed-use flight zones.

  A high-traffic general aviation airport and common training base for student pilots. It offers towered operations with a welcoming and instruction-friendly environment.

  A busy general aviation and corporate hub offering controlled pattern work, departure procedures, and great cross-country training opportunities.

  A quiet, non-towered airport south of the city — ideal for practicing radio communication, pattern entries, emergency procedures, and basic navigation.

- **Boulder City Municipal Airport (KBVU)** – Uncontrolled **(Class G)**  
  A scenic and versatile airport used for solo flights, checkride prep, and cross-country flights over **Lake Mead** and the **Hoover Dam**.
