#   steps: 
#     - title: "Meet Eligibility Requirements"
#       description: "The first step is confirming you meet the FAA’s basic requirements. You can begin training before you turn 17, but you must be at least 17 to receive your certificate. You’ll also need to be able to read, write, speak, and understand English, complete TSA or citizenship documentation, and obtain a 3rd-Class Medical Certificate through an Aviation Medical Examiner. Getting your medical early ensures you’re fully eligible to solo and progress through training without delays."

#         alt: "Medical certificate documents"
#     - title: "Ground School Training"
#       description: "Ground school provides the essential academic knowledge behind flying. You’ll study how airplanes work, how weather affects flight, how to navigate using charts, and how different classes of airspace operate. You’ll also learn FAA regulations, weight and balance, aircraft performance, and the decision-making skills expected of every safe pilot. This prepares you for both the written exam and real cockpit scenarios."

#     - title: "Flight Training"
#       description: "Flight training is where everything comes together. Under the guidance of a Vegas Aviation instructor, you’ll learn how to control the aircraft, take off, land, communicate on the radios, and safely handle different flight situations. You’ll master climbs, descents, turns, stalls, slow flight, emergency procedures, and the basics of cross-country navigation. Most students finish with 60-75 hours of flight time, giving them a strong foundation for solo flight."

#     - title: "Solo Flight Experience"
#       description: "Once you demonstrate consistent safety and proficiency, your instructor will endorse you for your first solo flight. Flying an airplane on your own for the first time is a milestone every pilot remembers. During this stage, you’ll gain experience operating independently in the traffic pattern, practicing maneuvers in the designated practice area, and building the confidence you need to fly without an instructor onboard."

#     - title: "Cross-Country and Night Training"

You’ll learn how to plan and execute cross-country flights during the day and at night, how to manage workload in unfamiliar environments, and how to use navigation tools ranging from pilotage and dead reckoning to GPS. This phase builds real-world skills that prepare you for both recreational flying and higher-level training."

You’ll begin with an oral exam that covers weather, regulations, aircraft systems, and flight planning, followed by a flight portion where you’ll demonstrate your ability to fly safely, navigate, and manage emergency scenarios. Once you pass, you’ll officially earn your Private Pilot License and gain the freedom to fly single-engine aircraft, continue training, or begin building toward a professional aviation career."
