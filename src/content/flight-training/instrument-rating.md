#   steps:
#     - title: "Meet Eligibility Requirements"
#       description: "To begin your Instrument Rating, you must already hold at least a Private Pilot License and have a current FAA medical certificate. Before training, you’ll complete TSA or citizenship verification and make sure you meet the FAA’s prerequisites, including recent flight experience and the foundational aeronautical skills gained during your Private Pilot training. These requirements ensure you’re ready to move into the precision and discipline required for instrument flight."

#     - title: "Ground School Training"
#       description: "Instrument ground school teaches you how to fly solely by reference to instruments—without relying on outside visual cues. You’ll learn advanced weather theory, IFR regulations, instrument navigation systems, approach procedures, enroute charts, ATC communication, and risk management. This knowledge prepares you for real IFR operations and builds the foundation needed to pass the FAA Instrument Knowledge Test."

#     - title: "Flight Training"
#       description: "During instrument flight training, you’ll learn how to control the aircraft by relying entirely on cockpit instruments. Your instructor will guide you through holding patterns, precision and non-precision approaches, instrument departures and arrivals, missed approaches, system failures, and IFR cross-country procedures. This phase builds your ability to fly safely in clouds, low visibility, and high-workload environments."

#     - title: "Simulated and Real-World IMC Training"
#       description: "You’ll build experience flying under simulated instrument conditions using a view-limiting device, as well as actual IMC (Instrument Meteorological Conditions) when weather allows. This training develops your situational awareness, precision, and ability to make timely decisions while managing multiple navigation and communication tasks in busy airspace."

#       description: "As you progress, you’ll complete long-distance IFR flights that teach you how to plan, file, and fly on an instrument flight plan. You’ll learn how to navigate using GPS, VORs, airways, and approach plates while coordinating with Air Traffic Control through every phase of the flight. This experience prepares you for real-world IFR operations and the workload management needed for safe instrument flying."

#       description: "Before your practical exam, you’ll complete the FAA Instrument Airman Knowledge Test. This written exam verifies your understanding of IFR charts, regulations, weather systems, navigation, and procedures. Vegas Aviation will help you prepare through guided study, review sessions, and instructor sign-offs to ensure you’re fully confident on test day."

#     - title: "Prepare for and Pass the Checkride"
#       description: "The final step is the FAA Instrument Rating checkride with a Designated Pilot Examiner. You’ll begin with an oral exam that covers IFR procedures, weather analysis, approach planning, systems knowledge, and decision-making. During the flight portion, you’ll demonstrate your ability to fly solely by reference to instruments, perform approaches, holds, missed approaches, and handle emergencies. Passing the checkride earns you your Instrument Rating and the ability to fly safely in a wider range of weather conditions."

    title: "Advantages of Having an Instrument Rating"
    subTitle: "What you get"
    description: "Obtaining an instrument rating on top of your private pilot license offers several significant advantages, including the ability to safely navigate through adverse weather conditions, fly in low visibility situations, and operate in controlled airspace with precision and confidence. With an IR, pilots can enhance their skills, expand their flying opportunities, and ensure a higher level of safety for themselves and their passengers."
    bullets:
      - "<b>Increased Safety:</b> Instrument flight training teaches you to fly solely by reference to the aircraft’s instruments, regardless of weather conditions or visibility."
      - "<b>Expanded Flying Opportunities:</b> With an instrument rating, you can legally fly when adverse weather conditions would otherwise ground a VFR (Visual Flight Rules) pilot."
      - "<b>Career Advancement:</b> Many career paths in aviation, including commercial airline pilot positions, require an instrument rating. Having this qualification opens up a wide range of job opportunities in both commercial and corporate aviation sectors."
      - "<b>Improved Flight Planning Skills:</b> Instrument flight training enhances your flight planning and navigation skills, as you learn to interpret weather forecasts, create flight plans, and execute precise instrument approaches."
      - "<b>Enhanced Confidence:</b> Mastering instrument flying instills confidence in your piloting abilities, knowing that you can safely navigate through challenging weather conditions and airspace environments."
