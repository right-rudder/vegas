      `I recently had the pleasure of completing a discovery flight with Vegas Aviation, and I can confidently say it was an unforgettable experience! From the moment I arrived, the warmth and friendliness of the owners and staff put me at ease. Their knowledge and passion for flying truly shine through.
      
      My instructor, Geo, took me up for the flight, and he was fantastic! His expertise and encouragement helped me feel comfortable right from the start. The scenery was breathtaking, and the thrill of being in the cockpit was exhilarating. Every moment was filled with excitement, and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to flying.
      
      I left the experience feeling inspired and eager to begin my training to get my pilot's license. If you're considering a discovery flight or looking to start your aviation journey, I highly recommend Vegas Aviation. You won't be disappointed.`,

      `My son took his first discovery flight today. His instructor was Dorian, who was absolutely amazing. We were originally scheduled for a discovery flight two weeks ago and were second in line for takeoff when an incoming plane declared an emergency, And landed on its belly. That shut down the airport for 12 hours, but wow, what a first experience that we got to see firsthand as we were second in line for takeoff when it happened. Dorian went through all of the emergency procedures and exactly what was happening with the tower With the airplane. That experience alone probably weighed more than his first flight today. Today's flight was about 45 minutes and it was absolutely beautiful. My son had the controls for half the time, including for takeoff and landing. Dorian was cool as a cucumber and made my son feel very safe and gave absolutely incredible instruction! If you're looking for a flight school, I would not look anywhere else!`,

      `I've used a variety of flight schools in the Las Vegas Area, and Vegas Aviation has definitely been the best one. My main concerns at the beginning of my flight training were the quality and availability of the planes and instructors, but none of that has been a problem for me during my time here. Another major concern of mine was pricing. I will say that rental prices are slightly higher than other flight schools in the area, but through getting my Private Pilot License I learned that you get what you pay for. If I could start my training all over again I would picked Vegas Aviation sooner to save more time and money in the long run.`,

    quote:`Vegas Aviation is top notch. I switched over to VA from another school in the valley to finish my PPL and immediately felt right at home.
      
      The rates are more than fair, all of the instructors are great, the aircraft are meticulously maintained and feature some really nice upgrades (G5 panels on the 172N is a great solution in between steam and G1000), and Louis is the kindest, warmest, most genuine business owner you will ever meet. Thank you, VA for everything you do!

      If anyone is reading this and is on the fence about flight schools, do yourself a favor and give VA a try! You will immediately feel like part of the family the moment you walk in the door.`,

    quote:`Hands down the best flight school in the area! Their flight instructors are experienced, knowledgeable, and truly passionate about aviation. They have a talent for breaking down complex concepts, making learning to fly both accessible and enjoyable.

      They also have a wonderful maintenance crew that continually ensures every aircraft is in perfect condition. Knowing that the planes are meticulously maintained provides an extra layer of confidence when you're up in the air. Safety is clearly a priority here, and it shows.

      Finally, the overall atmosphere at the school is incredibly supportive. From the office staff to the instructors and fellow students, everyone is positive and encouraging with a focus on helping each other succeed. I highly recommend Vegas Aviation to anyone aiming for a private pilots license or looking to start a career in aviation!`,
